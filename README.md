# ðŸ§  Intent Classification using Utterances

This project aims to predict customer **intents** based on **utterances** (text inputs) using a variety of machine learning and deep learning models. The dataset contains customer service-related queries, and the goal is to classify these into specific intent categories.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

- **Input:** `utterance` (short user queries or messages)
- **Target:** `intent` (corresponding action or query type)

> The dataset is already pre-split into training (6539 samples) and validation (818 samples) sets.
